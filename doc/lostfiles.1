.SH USER-DEFINED EXCLUDES
The \fB/etc/lostfiles.conf\fP file can be customized with an user-defined list of paths to include and exclude when running in relaxed mode.
.PP
Each line beginning with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign, followed by an absolute path, will respectively include or exclude that path from the results. An asterisk (*) wildcard can be used as a placeholder matching any string.
.PP
Additionally, more complicated exclusion filters can be expressed by a line beginning with a dollar ($) sign, followed by command-line arguments to pass to the \fBfind\fP utility.

Finally, lines beginning with a number sign (#) are interpreted as comments.
