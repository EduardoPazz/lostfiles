.SH USER-DEFINED EXCLUDES
/etc/lostfiles.conf can be customized with a list of paths to include and exclude when running in relaxed mode. Each line beginning with a plus (+) or minus (-) sign, followed by an absolute path, will respectively include or exclude that path from the results. An asterisk (*) wildcard can be used as a placeholder matching any string. Additionally, more complicated exclusion filters can be expressed by a line beginning with a dollar ($) sign, followed by command-line arguments to pass to the find utility. Finally, lines beginning with a number sign (#) are interpreted as comments.
